# Nutrition BLog

Nutrition Blog application, I built three years ago. It was my first project written in python using Django web framework. Application includes authentication features for registration, logging, in, changing the password and changing profile information. Authorization system of the app differentiates between readers and admins and different CRUD functionalities are available for readers and admins. Some of functionalities available for readers are leaving likes or dislikes and commenting the posts. On top of those functionilities, admins are also able tocreate new topics and to create and change posts using built-in markdown text-editors. Also users are able to search through the posts depending on different criterias such as upload date or rating. From other features it's worth mentioning the RSS feed functionalities and email subsrcription options. The email subsrcription features were built using [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) , python library managing for automatic periodic tasks.
